To save and execute the Python code, you'll need to follow these steps:

1.Save the Python Code:
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VSCode, Sublime Text).
Copy the Python code and paste it into the text editor.
Save the file with a '.py' extension, for example, 'format_usb.py'.

2. Run the Python Script:
Open a command prompt (CMD) or terminal.
-Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script using the 'cd' command. For example:
cd path\to\your\script
-Run the script using the 'python' command (make sure you have Python installed on your system). For example:
python format_usb.py
-If you are using Python 3, you might need to use 'python3' instead of 'python':
python3 format_usb.py

3.Administrator Privileges (Optional):
If the script encounters permission issues, you may need to run the command prompt or terminal as an administrator.
Right-click on the command prompt or terminal icon and select "Run as administrator."
Run the script again.

Note:
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.
If you are using a different operating system (e.g., Linux or macOS), the process may vary slightly. You might need to use chmod to make the script executable or use a different shebang line at the beginning of the script.
